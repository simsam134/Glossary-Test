# Glossary-Test
A quiz-like application built in QT where it is up to the user to set the questions. 
This was mainly designed for glossary-tests whilst learning a new language. Main purpose of this project was to try out and learn QT.

The user loads a csv-file in the format: 
word1, answer1
word2, answer2 etc..

4 alternatives are presented whilst doing the quiz were the wrong alternatives are just taken from other questions.

Features that should be added:
- An end-screen once a test is done with statistics and list of the wrong words, instead of just going to the main menu.
- Dynamic size
- Sound and graphic improvments
